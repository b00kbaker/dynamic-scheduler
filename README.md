# dynamic-scheduler

 A dynmaic Workday Planner with 9am-5pm time blocks, each hour has a text area which can be saved and viewed multiple times per out the day but will be reset to blank on the following calendar day. For visual clarity, during the hours of the workday each hour period is color coded based on its status as past (grey), present (red), or future (green).
