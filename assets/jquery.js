// jquery



console.log(dayjs(), "Dayjs")

// Figure out time/date plug in

// Global var
  //var whatPlans
  //   

// Functions

// function saveHour()


// How will it work?
  //As each hour passes the color gets faded out and no more interation is allowed (if statmenent? if time = past no action on "done" button or editing text box)

 //Time is only 9am-5pm   (diff)

 //Future time in 1 color
 //Past is 2 color
 //Present is 3 color
 
 //Reset color on every hour (event listener on time?)  

 //When "save" is clicked add text plans + assigned time to localStorage  

 //Recognized new day (AKA midnight) and all text empties
